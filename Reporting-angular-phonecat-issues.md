I noticed a lot of the issues were self explanatory.  These guys have worked to put up a decent tutorial.  If chrome crashes, close it down and restart - worked for me.  If an angular component is missing, you see the path in the error, so go download it.

** REMINDER: As dependencies are introduced, rerun npm install or if bower is installed globally, bower install.**
